                        <p class="intro">Bootcamp is an intense, pre-entry immersive that is the required entry-point of Parsons legendary MFA Design+Technology program. Nothing compares. By the end of Bootcamp you will have achieved higher consciousness (and you will be exhausted).</p>

                        <p class="info-body"><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>Bootcamp accomplishes two things. It expands your skills in the areas of <strong>code, interaction, and design process.</strong> Perhaps more important, it is an immersive and concentrated introduction to the critical studio environment, and the community you will spend two years (and the rest of your life) with.</p>

                        <p class="info-body"><strong>Dates: Sunday July 30th, through Saturday August 19th.</strong><br>
                        Three studios per day, five days a week.. Three weeks running. You'll then have a week off between Bootcamp and the start of school. You'll need it.</p>

                        <p class="info-body"><strong>Cost: $2289</strong><br>We’ve kept it as cheap as possible (this is a non-credit session). We offer a (very) limited number of tuition waivers to MFADT students, but it is important that you not count on receiving scholarship.</p>

                        <p class="info-body"><strong>Bootcamp attendance is not optional!</strong><br> All incoming MFA Design+Technology candidates are expected to attend this three week Bootcamp pre-orientation intensive. Exceptions must be approved by the program director in advance.</p>

                        <p class="info-body"><strong>Pizza kick off On July 30th 2018, 6:30pm</strong><br>(Sunday night before Bootcamp Day 1), there will be a pizza-and-drinks-powered event on the Lower Level, University Center, 13th Street and 5th Avenue. You will meet your incoming first year peers and the rising second year MFADT Bootcamp faculty. You’ll be assigned to your sections and meet your Bootcamp classmates. You’ll learn your schedules, get your pictures taken, and eat pizza! This is a great time to socialize, ask questions, and hit the ground running! Professors Anne Gaines (AMT Dean), and Sven Travis (MFADT Director) will be there. You’ll learn to party the <strong>MFADT way!</strong>
